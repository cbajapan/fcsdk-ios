# ACBClientCall

Please see <doc:VideoCalls> for an explanation of how to use ACBClientCall

## Overview

```swift

    @objc final public var hasRemoteAudio: Bool { get }

    @objc final public var remoteView: UIView?

    @objc final public func remoteBufferView() async -> UIView?

    /// The client should always remove the `remoteBufferView()` when finished using the bufferView.
